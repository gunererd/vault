Overall, it’s a masterpiece in system design books. However, no book can cover everything in system design. No one knows every system. Here are some of my other recommendations:  
  
\-- designing data-intensive applications. Highly recommended.  
\-- system design primer github repo. Highly recommended free resource.  
\-- Leetcode discussion forum about system designs.  
\-- Grokking the system interview course. This is an ok resource but not very deep.  
\-- Various youtube channels. I like channels like Tushar Roy, System Design Interview, Success in Tech, etc. There are a lot more but I found them most useful for senior engineer positions.  
\-- Various tech blogs: Facebook, Netflix, Uber, AirBnb, etc. Those tech blogs are extremely valuable to help us understand real-life systems.  
\-- highscalability website. The website contains lots of real world systems.  
\-- InfoQ youtube channel. Many tech companies talk about how they scale their systems at infoQ. I find sometimes it’s quite hard to find useful videos on google but when I narrow down it to a specific channel, it’s much easier to find. For example, I found a lot of useful tech talks about uber there. It’s invaluable when I interviewed there
